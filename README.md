## Open-Source Packages

The following are stable and open-source programming packages developed and released by the Voytek Lab. 

### fooof 
[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/fooof.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fooof/)

A [python package](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof) for parameterizing neural power spectra.

This package also has a [Matlab wrapper](https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof_mat). 

### neurodsp

[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/neurodsp.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/neurodsp/)

A [python package](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp) for common analyses on neural time series.

### bycycle
[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bycycle.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bycycle/)

A [python package](https://github.com/voytekresearch/bycycle) for cycle-by-cycle analysis of waveforms.

### pacpy
[![Project Status: Inactive – The project has reached a stable, usable state but is no longer being actively developed; support/maintenance will be provided as time allows.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/inactive.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#inactive)
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pacpy.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pacpy/)

A [python package](https://github.com/voytekresearch/pacpy) for calculating the any different ways to measure phase-amplitude coupling.

A MATLAB wrapper for this package was made and is available as [pacmat](https://github.com/voytekresearch/pacmat)

## Packages in development

The following are open-source programming packages in developement by the Voytek lab. 

### fakespikes

A [python package](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fakespikes) for simulating statistical spiking models. 

### chinoise

A [python package](https://github.com/voytekresearch/chinoise) for creating simple LFP simulations, with 1/f noise.

## Tutorials

We have developed a set of [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials) that cover the basics of the standard analyses related to the kind of research we do. There are also tutorial materials as part of the [neurodsp](https://github.com/voytekresearch/neurodsp/tree/master/tutorials) and [fooof](https://github.com/voytekresearch/fooof/tree/master/tutorial) pacakages. 

## Other Code
