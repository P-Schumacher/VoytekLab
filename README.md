## Packages in development

The following are open-source programming packages in developement by the Voytek lab. 

### fakespikes

## Tutorials

We have developed a set of [tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/voytekresearch/tutorials) that cover the basics of the standard analyses related to the kind of research we do. For tutorials related to particular software packages, check their docsites. 

## Other Code

### rvandermeij_voytek
